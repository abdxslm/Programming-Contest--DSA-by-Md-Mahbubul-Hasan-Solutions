# Solutions to Problems from "Programming Contest: Data Structures and Algorithms" by Md. Mahbubul Hasan

This repository contains my solutions to problems inspired by the book **"Programming Contest: Data Structures and Algorithms"** by **Md. Mahbubul Hasan**. Please note that this repository does not include any copyrighted material, such as problem statements or direct excerpts from the book. Instead, it focuses on providing original code solutions and explanations that were inspired by the concepts discussed in the book.

## Introduction

This repository is intended to serve as a personal project, where I apply the concepts and techniques covered in *"Programming Contest: Data Structures and Algorithms"* by Md. Mahbubul Hasan to solve various problems. The repository is a learning tool and a reference for others who are studying similar topics.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by the chapters covered in the book, such as:

- Mathematics
- Sorting and Searching
- Data Structures
- Greedy Technique
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Adhoc Techniques
- Geometry and Computional Geometry
- String related algorithms

Each folder contains:

- **Code Solution:** My original implementation inspired by the problems discussed in the book.
- **Approach:** An explanation of the algorithm or method used in the solution.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have different approaches or enhancements, feel free to submit a pull request. Please avoid sharing any direct content from the book.

## Disclaimer

This repository is not affiliated with or endorsed by Md. Mahbubul Hasan or the publishers of *"Programming Contest: Data Structures and Algorithms."* The problems solved here are based on my understanding and are inspired by the topics discussed in the book. No proprietary or copyrighted material is included.

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to **Md. Mahbubul Hasan** for writing a book that inspired these solutions.
- Appreciation to the competitive programming community for their continuous support and collaboration.
